<p>It is well known that the Final Fantasy series is one of the most popular role-playing games in the gaming industry. However, nothing grabbed the attention of gamers as much as Final Fantasy VII. With its compelling story and combat features, Hironobu Sakaguchi and director Yoshinori Kitase take it to the next level. Of course, there were more games released within the series like VIII, IX, etc. However, with its vivid imagery and storyline, Final Fantasy VII left an impression on many gamers. In addition to its storyline and gaming experience, “It was the first to take advantage of the CD-ROM format, a decision that necessitated (or perhaps justified) Square's infamous break with Nintendo and new partnership with Sony.” (Loguidice, Barton, 2009). In other words, after separating from Nintendo, Square Enix joined Sony and with its celebration, Final Fantasy VII was the first game in the series to take a CD format, and the sequel games kept coming from there. Of course, Cloud is no longer the MC but who does not miss Cloud. </p>
