<p>Now, if we incorporate the new specs, well, the gaming experience just shot up. “So it goes, from this beginning to the climax of an epic journey. Scenes are now sequences, conversations character studies, and rest stops hubs of activity,” (Edge. 2024). In other words, the whole storytelling changed from the usual speech bubbles and blocked characters to a full cinematic experience. Conversational schemes went from speech bubbles to cinema interactions with sequential cutscenes that can be a movie. It can be said that the whole game is a retelling of Cloud’s journey with his pals but with a bit of extra action and imagination as Edge magazine reviews, “As Square Enix demonstrated with Final Fantasy VII: Remake, revisiting a previously published work can be about a lot more than providing a faithful, refurbished retelling. It can also be a reimagining, a restructuring, or a revisioning,” (Edge, 2023). What can be said about this cinema of a game? Action and fascination.</P>

<P>Director Yoshinori Kitase already had the talks about remaking the whole game of Final Fantasy VII. “Talk of remaking 1997’s FFVII began in 2005, a year that saw the release of computer-animated film sequel Advent Children and an E3 tech demo that recreated the game’s opening sequence using the then cutting-edge PS3 hardware,” (Kitase, 2024). And what a wonderful job he did. The original creator, Hironobu Sakaguchi, began the storyline and creation of Final Fantasy VII, and Kitase, with the decision of redeveloping it further with the help of Tetsuya Nomura, Naoki Hamguchi and Motomu Toriyama. In fact, director Naoki Hamaguch was only in high school when the original FFVII was released. The storyline remains the same, no destruction of the original story. Changes that were made involve the graphics and story interactions, along with character design. They are more lifelike, like anime shows, and incredibly beautiful.</P>
