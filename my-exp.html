<p>This page is solely based on my experience in playing the game. I will be honest, it is a very amateurish sight. If I were to compete with another gamer, I would probably lose. I do play games and I consider myself a gamer. Am I very good player, well it depends on how many times I have played and how much I grasp the controls and the rules. I am by no means a slow learner. In fact, as quickly as the rules are shown and the moves displayed on the screen, so is my brain.</p>

<p>Enjoy these previews and gameplay(The best I could do. More experience in the future). There will be more coming in the future if possible.</p>
