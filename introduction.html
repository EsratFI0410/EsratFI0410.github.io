<p>It is well known that the Final Fantasy series is one of the most popular role-playing games in the gaming industry. However, nothing grabbed the attention of gamers as much as Final Fantasy VII. With its compelling story and combat features, Hironobu Sakaguchi and director Yoshinori Kitase take it to the next level. Of course, there were more games released within the series like VIII, IX, etc. However, with its vivid imagery and storyline, Final Fantasy VII left an impression on many gamers. In addition to its storyline and gaming experience, “It was the first to take advantage of the CD-ROM format, a decision that necessitated (or perhaps justified) Square's infamous break with Nintendo and new partnership with Sony.” (Loguidice, Barton, 2009). In other words, after separating from Nintendo, Square Enix joined Sony and with its celebration, Final Fantasy VII was the first game in the series to take a CD ROM, and the sequel games kept coming from there. Of course, Cloud is no longer the MC but who does not miss Cloud.</P> 

<p>However, as I said, who can forget Cloud? The impact was so huge that moving forward to 2020, with the release of PlayStation 5, Final Fantasy VII received a reboot with its story broken into three parts. 2020 released part 1: Final Fantasy VII: Remake. Part 2 was released February of last year, 2024 named Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth. A PC version of part 2 was released at the beginning of this year, the month of January. Part 3 is in the works, but release date is unknown.</P>

<p>However, that is not the issue. There are no issues, just information. From the original Final Fantasy VII and its reboot, what are the differences and experiences? What improvements were made and upgraded? With these improvements, did gaming experience change or is it the same? Anyways, whatever they are, led them to their victory of winning several awards for their graphics and entertainment along with musical score and background. Despite not winning all the awards, it does not change the fact it has become one of the greatest games ever played and is still being played, all with its new specs and graphic effects.</p>
