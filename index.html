<p>Welcome to the a website of fun as I expand my foundation essay to simpler terms and comments. I hope to draw in many players like me or new players. It is an information website with facts and comments about one of my favorite games Final Fantasy VII. It is mostly about its popularity and changes that were made to game after its reboot with the titles Final Fantasy VII: Remake and Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and its future sequel which has no name yet but is under development.</P>

<p>It is not a persuasive type website or a review. It is a website for information and ideas if a future gamer is looking for a game to play or having thoughts about playing this game. Comments and questions are allowed but WARNING! No unaccaptable comments. You are entitled to your opinion but I will not tolerate negative comments.</P>
