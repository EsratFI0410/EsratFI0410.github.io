<h1>Final Fantasy VII:Remake/Rebirth vs. Final Fantasy Original</h1>

 

<P>From images of the original FFVII to current graphics of FFVII: Remake and Rebirth there is an enormous difference between character portrayal and story portrayal. It is 4KHD. In addition to the picture changes, with the addition of cutscenes that play out and form a movie is a whole new change. In game character choices are available as well, with lifelike features and activity. When playing the game, the combat experience is so much more concise, and cleaner compared to the choppy flow of the original game. Sometimes remakes of games are not recommended but in FFVII it just works. It will be one of those games that will not stop playing, even if I finish the game itself. And to be honest, Cloud Strife is a complex character that just draws you in.</P>

<p> My Input: In addition to character design, combat experience is more efficient, like the materias in the game. They look more like power orbs than in the previous original creation. Their power elements are more profound and realistic.In addition, the combat equipments such as skill books and armor are also made avaliable. </p>
